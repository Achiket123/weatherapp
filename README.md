# Weather App in Flutter

## Overview

This Flutter weather app provides real-time weather information based on user's location. It offers a clean and intuitive interface for users to check current weather conditions, forecasts, and more.

# API- [weatherapi](''https://weatherapi.com]')

## Weather API Integration

This weather app relies on a Weather API to fetch real-time weather data. We've integrated a powerful API to provide accurate and up-to-date information. If you'd like to use this app or contribute to its development, you'll need to obtain an API key and configure it in the project.

### Obtaining an API Key

To get started, follow these steps:

1. **Sign up for an API Key:**

   Visit the website of the Weather API provider and sign up for an account. Once registered, you should be able to generate an API key from your account dashboard.

2. **Configure the API Key:**

   Once you have your API key, open the project and locate the configuration file where API keys are stored. Typically, this file is named `main.dart` or similar. Replace the placeholder `YOUR_API_KEY_HERE` with the actual API key you obtained.

   Example:

   ```dart
   // lib/main.dart

      const String APIKEY = 'YOUR_API_KEY_HERE';  
## Features
